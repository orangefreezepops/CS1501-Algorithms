Name:  Keegan Fouse

Lecture section:  SEC1270

Recitation day and time:  Wed 7:50-8:40

Assignment #:  1

Program due date:  9/16/20

Handed in date:  9/16/20

Source code file name(s): DLBNode.java, DLBTrie.java, ac_test.java







Other file name(s) (if relevant):







Does your program run without error?: 
        
    -it runs with no errors, but not correctly

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

    -the program will run, accept input, write to the user_history.txt file
     and display the timing functions. But I can't get the predictions to populate
     which then throws java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException if you type in a number 
     to select a suggestion






Additional comments to the grader:

    -i have a series of print statements commented out in the files, you will see 
     that my trie is being populated correctly if you uncomment them, i just 
     can't figure how to make the predictions appear

CS1501 Assignment 1 - De La Brandeis Trie Autocompletion Test

My approach to this project was initially aided by our TA Max,
I followed his tutorial on building the structure of the DLBNode and Trie 
for the dictionary, and for simplicity's sake I continued to
use the DLBTrie as the data structure for storing the users previously entered words.
Aside from the instruction he provided I added some value and key properties to the 
DLBNode to try to make it easier when accessing the user history and making predictions
As for storing the predictions I chose to use an ArrayList because I like the 
simplicity of adding and getting items, though that doesn't really matter 
because I couldn't get it to work

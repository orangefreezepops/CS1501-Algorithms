To implement the Apartment PQ I made an array of Apartment objects for
both price and size and then 4 hash symbol tables (min (priceIndex, priceCity), max (sizeIndex, sizeCity))
using SeparateChainingHashST.java class given to us on the class site. I chose this approach because
they allow the Apartment arrays to be indexable, and also the linked structure of
the symbol table is ideal for subsets of the apartment PQ allowing for efficient
retrieval from the entire set and of given cities. Also this way I didn't have to
implement a whole wad of extra classes and edit them for Apartment objects,
because the SeparateChainingHashST allows for generic values I could simply pass
the Apartment objects to it for the Price and Size hash tables and use Integers for the
indirection index hash tables. It was the simplest approach I could see
that allowed me to only edit the 3 files AptTracker.java, Apartment.java and AptPQ.java
